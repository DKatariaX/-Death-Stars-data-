# -Death-Stars-data-
This repo has the data I used for the death stars case study. The VOTable files I used can be found here. 
This repo also contains my failed attempt to create a "push run and make things happen" python script (gave up pretty early on). Also included are the excel files I planned on using. DON'T USE THEM PLEASE, I accidently rounded my r_min and t_yrs values to 2 dp and, since it was a .csv file, i irreversibly saved those changes.
